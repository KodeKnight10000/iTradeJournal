# iTradeJournal
AI-powered trading journal with automated trade extraction from screenshots, Logging and Data Analytics 
iTrade Journal – AI-Powered Trading Discipline &
Performance Tracker
White Paper – August 2025
Abstract
iTrade Journal is a next-generation trading journal that automates trade logging,
compliance monitoring, and performance analysis through AI-powered screenshot parsing
and personalized coaching. Instead of manually typing trade details, traders upload a
screenshot from their platform. The system extracts trade data using OCR and AI parsing,
compares it to the trader’s pre-set rules and goals, and provides real-time feedback,
statistical projections, and actionable adjustments.
1. Introduction
Consistent profitability in trading requires two elements: a robust, well-defined trading plan,
and discipline in following that plan. Most traders fail not due to lack of strategy, but due to
emotional deviation from their rules. Traditional trading journals require tedious manual
input, which discourages consistent use. iTrade Journal solves this problem by eliminating
manual logging through AI-powered screenshot recognition, tracking plan adherence in
real time, and providing personalized performance insights.
2. Problem Statement
- Manual data entry is tedious → Traders often skip journaling after busy sessions.
- No objective compliance tracking → Most traders rely on memory or biased
self-assessment.
- Delayed feedback → Without fast performance analysis, bad habits persist.
- Lack of projections → Traders don’t see where their current behavior will lead.

iTrade Journal provides an automated, AI-powered feedback loop for traders. Key features
include AI Screenshot Parsing, Trader Profile Setup, Real-Time Compliance Check, AI
Summarized Insights, Statistical Projections, and Behavior Tracking.
